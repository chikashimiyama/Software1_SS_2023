# K3: Additive/Subtractive Synthesis

## Additive Synthesis

Additive synthesis is a sound synthesis technique that creates timbre by adding sine waves together.

The timbre of musical instruments can be considered in the light of Fourier theory to consist of multiple harmonic or inharmonic partials or overtones. Each partial is a sine wave of different frequency and amplitude that swells and decays over time due to modulation from an ADSR envelope.

### Assignment 1
Apply different fixed length envelope (for example using function and line~) to each partial of the patch above.

### Assignment 2
On top of assignment 1, modify 2, 3 ,4 and 5 in the *~ objects to some random float numbers and create an inharmonic additive synthesizer.

### Assignment 3
Add two knobs to the patch for vibrato.
- a knob controls the speed of vibrato (1 ~ 20 Hz)
- the other knob controls the depth of vibrato (0 to 100 cents where 100 cents = 1 semitone)

### Assignment 4
Discuss what the advantage or disadvantage of additive synthesis compared to wavetable synthesis?

### oscbank~ / ioscbank~
If you want to build a synthesizer using a lot of oscillators, oscbank~ or ioscbank~ come in handy.

## Subtractive Synthesis

[Stockhausen Studie II](https://youtu.be/Yc_FfWnttGw) exclusively uses this technique.

This technique offers a sort of natural touch (especially compared with wavetable synthesis) in the sound because of the dynamism in the white noise.

### Assignment 5

Use a [speech sample](K3/spoken.wav) or other sample instead of noise~ to test the effect further.

### Assignment 6

Study fftb~ function and filter the input with multiple resonant filter at the same time.
